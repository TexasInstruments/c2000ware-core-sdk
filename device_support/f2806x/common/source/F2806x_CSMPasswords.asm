;// TITLE:	F2806x Code Security Module Passwords.
;// 
;// DESCRIPTION:
;//
;//         This file is used to specify password values to
;//         program into the CSM password locations in Flash
;//         at 0x3F7FF8 - 0x3F7FFF.
;//
;//         In addition, the reserved locations 0x3F7F80 - 0x3F7FF5 are 
;//         all programmed to 0x0000

; The "csmpasswords" section contains the actual CSM passwords that will be
; linked and programmed into to the CSM password locations (PWL) in flash.  
; These passwords must be known in order to unlock the CSM module. 
; All 0xFFFF's (erased) is the default value for the password locations (PWL).

; It is recommended that all passwords be left as 0xFFFF during code
; development.  Passwords of 0xFFFF do not activate code security and dummy 
; reads of the CSM PWL registers is all that is required to unlock the CSM.  
; When code development is complete, modify the passwords to activate the
; code security module.

      .sect "csmpasswds"

; For code security operation, all addresses between 0x3F7F80 and
; 0x3F7FF5 cannot be used as program code or data.  These locations
; must be programmed to 0x0000 when the code security password locations
; (PWL) are programmed.  If security is not a concern, then these addresses
; can be used for code or data.  

; The section "csm_rsvd" can be used to program these locations to 0x0000.
