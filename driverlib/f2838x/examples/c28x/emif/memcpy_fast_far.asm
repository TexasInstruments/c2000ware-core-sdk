; AUTHOR:      David M. Alter, Texas Instruments Inc.
;
; HISTORY:
;   10/21/14 - original (D. Alter)
;
; DESCRIPTION: Optimized memory copy, src->dest.
;
; FUNCTION: 
;   extern void memcpy_fast_far(volatile void* dst, volatile const void* src, Uint16 N);
;
; USAGE:       memcpy_fast_far(dst, src, N);
;
; PARAMETERS:  volatile void* dst = pointer to destination
;              volatile const void* src = pointer to source
;              N = number of 16-bit words to copy
;
; RETURNS:     none
;
; BENCHMARK: The performance of this function differs depending on the
;    address alignment of the src and dst addresses (pointers).
;    - If both pointers have the same alignment (even or odd address),
;    then 32-bit copies are used for the bulk of the transfers.  This
;    allows performance to approach 1 cycle/word (16-bit word) plus
;    overhead.
;    - If the two pointers have different alignments (one even aligned,
;    the other odd aligned) then 16-bit transfers must be used.  This
;    provides performance approaching 2 cycles/word (16-bit word) plus
;    overhead.
;    The above benchmarks assume that the src and dst are located in
;    different internal RAM blocks (so there are no RAM stalls).
;
; NOTES:
;   1) The function checks for the case of N=0 and just returns if true.
;   2) This function is restricted to C28x devices with the FPU.
;   3) This function is intended for data above 22 bits address.
;      For input data at or below 22 bits address, use memcpy_fast
;      instead for better performance.
;   4) PREAD and PWRITE are used in the function, but this is OK with
;      above 22-bit address since the program bus is used for stack
;      access (below 22 bits).  The data bus is used for the >22-bit
;      address access.
