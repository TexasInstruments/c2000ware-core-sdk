%//! \brief  MATLAB code for the Real Fast Fourier Transform (real-time ADC)
%//! \author C2000
%//!  This matlab code is reference code for debugging FPU library
%//!  function RFFT_adc_f32
%//!   
%//!  Minimum CFFT_Stages is 5. The raw data with 12-bit ADC input format
%//!  is stored in "signal.txt". The data is read out by the matlab fscanf
%//!  function and normalized to the range of 0.0 to 0.1 by dividing by 4096. 
%//!  The real FFT result is stored in the variable X.
%//!
%//!  Watch Variables:
%//!    S               Normalized input signal
%//!    X               Output
